In order to use the MapKit features of the iPhone, you first must ensure that you have added the 
MapKit framework to your applicaiton. If you have never added a framework to XCode here is a link
to instructions from Apple 

http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#recipes/XcodeRecipes/Linking_to_Libraries_and_Frameworks/Linking_to_Libraries_and_Frameworks.html

If the above link is broken, it comes from the iOS Reference Library, XCode 3 Recipes document
and the Linking to Libraries and Frameworks chapter.

The first version of the Tyree Apps MapKit plugin for TapLynx requires locations to be in
latitude and longitude notation, rather than simple Street Address/Zip. There seems to
be a lot of licensing and marketing tied up with geocoding of addresses, so for now we
are leaving that step up to the user. For US based addresses we like www.geocoder.us but
there are many other free and paid services available.

[Adapt the Map Callouts Sample Code]

Make the default be Graceland

Pin colors are
MKPinAnnotationColorRed = 0
MKPinAnnotationColorGreen = 1
MKPinAnnotationColorPurple = 2

They are NSUInteger

You should use purple pins for the user defined items. So, we do that. If the person supplies an image then we use it, otherwise, we use a purple pin.

There is an array and a dictionary in the plist. Each Location has

UIImage* image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"map_button_icon_locate.png"];
	_geoButton = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithImage:image
												  style:UIBarButtonItemStyleBordered
												 target:self
												 action:@selector(geoLocationTouched:)];
	_geoButton.width = image.size.width + 10;
